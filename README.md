# Learning the basics of Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

## Introduction

- My goal is to learn the basics of Data Strucutures and algorithms using JavaScript.
- This repository was created by me for educational purposes only and all the material I used as reference is linked in the Reference section below.
